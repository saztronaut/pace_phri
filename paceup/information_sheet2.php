What is the PACE-UP trial?</a>
</h4>
</div>

<div id="collapse1" class="panel-collapse collapse in">
<div class="panel-body"><p>The PACE-UP trial investigated whether people, aged 45-74 years, become more active if they are given a pedometer (a monitor that counts steps) with a physical activity diary and guidance on a 12-week programme to increase their walking (please see www.paceup.sgul.ac.uk for more details).  We have found using a pedometer can lead to increased physical activity levels. If people are able to maintain these physical activity levels this would lead to important health benefits.</p>

<div id="collapse2" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body"><p>We are now interested in moving our findings from research into routine care. Specifically we are interested in finding the best way to deliver this physical activity programme to patients. We have also developed an online version of the PACE-UP resources and a mobile app in addition to paper resources which we are looking to trial.

Do I have to take part?</a>
</h4>
</div>
<div id="collapse4" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body"><p>No, it is up to you to decide. If you do not want to take part your care from the practice will not be affected in any way. If you decide to join in, you can change your mind later and leave at any time. This will not affect your future health care. However, we may use information that you have already given us. </p>

<div id="collapse5" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body"><p>As part of your NHS Health Check, a nurse will have been given you a pack which includes a pedometer, physical activity diary, handbook, consent form and two freepost envelopes. The pack provides instructions about the effective 12-week PACE-UP walking programme and details for contacting us for telephone or online support.</p>
<p> If you are happy to take part once you have read this information sheet, then please sign and return the consent form (keeping the bottom copy for yourself) and return the top copy in the freepost envelope.</p>
<p>
Once the consent form is returned, you are ready to start the 12-week PACE-UP walking programme. As part of the 12-week programme we want you to record your physical activity. You can choose to do this either using the paper physical activity diary provided or online via our website or via the mobile app. It is entirely up to you and whatever suits you best.</p>
<p> Once you’ve finished the 12-week walking programme, please post back your paper physical activity diary (if you were using one). </p>
