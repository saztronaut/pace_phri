How much physical activity should you do for health benefits?</a>

<div class="panel-body"><p>You should aim to be active daily. Over a week, activity should add up to at least <b>150 minutes</b> (2.5 hours) of <b>moderate intensity activity</b> in <b>bouts of 10 minutes</b> or more.</p>
<div class="row text-center"><div class="col-sm-12">
<p>One good way to approach this is to do <b>30 minutes activity on at least 5 days a week</b>. This is part of the UK physical activity guidelines for health for adults and older adults (see <a href="www.nhs.uk/livewell/fitness"> activity guidelines on the NHS website </a>) </p>

<ul type='circle'>
<li>Begin to breathe a bit quicker</li>
<li>Feel your heart beating a bit faster </li>
<li>Feel warmer</li>
<li>You should still be able to talk whilst you are doing moderate activity.</li>

<h4  class="text-center">How can walking help?</h4>
<p class="text-center">Walking at approximately 3 miles (5 km) per hour counts as moderate intensity activity.</p>
<p  class="text-center">This can be translated into steps per minute and measured with a pedometer.  </p>
<p class="text-center">Roughly <b>1500</b> steps in <b>15</b> minutes counts as <b>15 minutes</b> of moderate intensity activity. </p>
<p class="text-center">Roughly <b>3000</b> steps in <b>30</b> minutes counts as <b>30 minutes</b> of moderate intensity activity. </p>

<p class="text-center"><b>PACE-UP aims to increase the amount that you walk each week, using a target number of steps measured by a pedometer.</b></p>

<p class="text-center"><b>The UK physical activity guidelines also advise that all adults and older adults should minimise the amount of time that they spend being sedentary (sitting) for extended periods. Taking regular short walks can help you to do this. </b></p>

<h4> How can you increase your walking in a safe way?</h4>
<p><b>- Start low-and-go-slow!</b> This means making any changes in a gradual way.</p>
<p><b>- Gradually increase</b> both the amount of walking that you do (the number of steps per day) and the intensity (how fast you walk).</p>
<p><b>- Walking at a moderate intensity is safe</b> for most people. If you find it difficult to do 1500 steps in 15 minutes, then you can go more slowly at first and build up gradually.</p>
<p><b>- Wear sturdy shoes or trainers</b> when you walk.  You will be less likely to cause pain in your feet and other joints.</p>
<p><b>- If you feel at all unsteady</b>, try using a walking stick or walking with a friend.</p>
<p><b>- Take some water with you</b> if you are walking a long distance, especially if it is hot weather.</p>
<p><b>- Regular walking is good for arthritis and back pain</b>, but if walking aggravates these problems, you may have done too much too quickly. Rest for a day or so and then try doing slightly less next time.</p>
<p><b>- If walking more or faster gives you chest pain, palpitations or dizziness</b>, or makes you feel faint or fall over, you should stop doing it and tell your GP.</p>
<p><b>- If you are concerned about street safety</b>, identify your local crime hotspots in your area by putting your postcode into <a href="http://www.police.uk">http://www.police.uk</a> and check out advice on keeping yourself safe on <a href="https://www.suzylamplugh.org/Pages/FAQs/Category/personal-safety">https://www.suzylamplugh.org/Pages/FAQs/Category/personal-safety</a></p>

How to keep going when PACE-UP finishes</a>
</h3>
</div>
<div id="collapse5" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body"> <h4>Some handy hints </h4>
<p> - Keep the habit of going for a 30 minute walk or doing 30 minutes of other moderate activity to keep up your step-count, most days of the week.</p>
<p> - Keep your pedometer and use it sometimes to show you how active you are. It is easy to be very busy without being very active, the pedometer shows you accurately how many steps you are taking.</p>
<p> - Remind yourself about what you have achieved by increasing your activity and any positive benefits it has had on your health, weight, mood, sleeping etc. This may motivate you to keep up good habits, or to try again if you feel you have slipped back.</p>
<p> - Enlist a friend or family member to walk with you, it is easier to walk regularly and walk further if you have some company.</p>
<p> - Try out new walks near you or think about a walking group, the websites listed have lots of ideas for local walks, or your local library will have information.</p>
<strong> You can also carry on recording your steps on this website after the 12 weeks are finished</strong>
