<h4 >What is the PACE-UP trial?</h4>
<p>The PACE-UP trial investigated whether people, aged 45-74 years, become more active if they are given a pedometer (a monitor that counts steps) with a physical activity diary and guidance on a 12-week programme to increase their walking (please see www.paceup.sgul.ac.uk for more details).  We have found using a pedometer can lead to increased physical activity levels. If people are able to maintain these physical activity levels this would lead to important health benefits.</p>
<h4>What is the purpose of this study?</h4>
<p>We are now interested in moving our findings from research into routine care. Specifically we are interested in finding the best way to deliver this physical activity programme to patients. We have also developed an online version of the PACE-UP resources and a mobile app in addition to paper resources which we are looking to trial.
</p>
<h4 > Why have I been chosen?</h4>
<p>We are inviting people identified through routine NHS health checks to take part in this study.</p>
<h4>Do I have to take part?</h4>
<p>No, it is up to you to decide. If you do not want to take part your care from the practice will not be affected in any way. If you decide to join in, you can change your mind later and leave at any time. This will not affect your future health care. However, we may use information that you have already given us. </p>
<h4>What would taking part involve?</h4>
<p>As part of your NHS Health Check, a nurse will have been given you a pack which includes a pedometer, physical activity diary, handbook, consent form and two freepost envelopes. The pack provides instructions about the effective 12-week PACE-UP walking programme and details for contacting us for telephone or online support.</p>
<p> If you are happy to take part once you have read this information sheet, then please sign and return the consent form (keeping the bottom copy for yourself) and return the top copy in the freepost envelope.</p>
<p> Once the consent form is returned, you are ready to start the 12-week PACE-UP walking programme. As part of the 12-week programme we want you to record your physical activity. You can choose to do this either using the paper physical activity diary provided or online via our website or via the mobile app. It is entirely up to you and whatever suits you best.</p>
<p> Once you&#8217;ve finished the 12-week walking programme, please post back your paper physical activity diary (if you were using one). </p>
<h4>Are there any benefits from taking part? </h4>
<p>We cannot promise that the study will help you, but there are many health benefits from walking more and becoming more active.</p>
<h4>Are there any risks from taking part?</h4>
<p>This is a very low risk study, we have shown the PACE-UP trial to be both effective and safe. If you should develop any new health complaints please consult your GP as normal.</p>
<p>You should not take part if you have had previous falls, have very poor vision or balance, or if you have had a heart attack or a heart operation in the last 3 months. If you are unsure, you can discuss this with your GP. </p>
<h4>Are there any expenses or payments?
</h4>
<p>If you take part in the study it will not cost you any money and you do not need to buy any special equipment. We will provide you with free-post envelopes to return any paperwork to us. The pedometer we provide you with, is yours to keep.</p> 
<h4>Will my taking part in this study be kept confidential?</h4>
<p>Yes.  We will follow ethical and legal rules. All information about you will be handled in confidence and kept strictly confidential.</p>
<ul type="circle">
<li>If you take part in an interview with a researcher to discuss your experience of being involved in this study, the interview will be audio-recorded. </li>
<li>Audio-recorded interviews will be anonymised by the Research Assistant. </li>
<li>Nothing that could reveal your identity will be disclosed outside of your practice or St George&#8217;s University of London</li></ul>
<h4>Complaints/Problems</h4>
<p>If you are concerned about any part of this study, please contact a member of the research team (<a href="#collapse15">contact details here</a>). We will respond to any complaint about the way you have been dealt with during the study. If you want to complain formally, you can do this through the NHS Complaints Procedure. You can get details of this procedure from your general practice.</p>
<h4>What will happen to the results of the research study?</h4>
<p>The results will be used to inform larger scale research projects. Individual participants will not be identifiable from any report, presentation or publication placed in the public domain.</p> 
<h4>Who is organising and funding the research?  </h4>
<p>The research is supported by the South London CLAHRC (Collaboration of Leadership in Applied Healthcare Research).</p> 

<h4> Who has reviewed the study? </h4> 
<p>All research in the NHS is looked at by an independent group of people called a Research Ethics Committee, to protect your interests. This study has been reviewed and given a favourable opinion by the London Hampstead Research Ethics Committee.</p>
